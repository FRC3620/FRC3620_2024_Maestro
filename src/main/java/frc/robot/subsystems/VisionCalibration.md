# Vision Calibration 
    UNITS IN METERS, degrees FOR VISION SUBSYSTEM

    1. MAKE SURE LIMELIGHT IS PLUGGED IN
    2. Confirm apriltag is in the right spot: height should be around 1.45 meters, should be centered on speaker.
    3. Use phone measurement app to check relative camera angle: it should be around 23 degrees. If not, you can change that in limelight.
    4. Check Camera offset numbers: height, camera to front of the bumper -- can change in VISION SUBSYSTEM. Check to confirm camera is parallel to front of bumper. Check to make sure camera is centered.
    5. Check distances -- center should be on April tag:
        - Check from center of speaker base: 3ft, 5ft, 7ft, 9ft, and 11ft, make sure it reads the right distance
        - Check from where crosshair on limelight is in middle of tag: should be _______
        - Repeat steps for both sides of speaker base: for Mason, 3ft, 5ft, 7ft should be adequate
        - Repeat all steps above for other side of the field
    6. IF numbers are off, collect measured samples from step 3 and change offset numbers in the VISION SUBSYSTEM
